Busting my brain over lines of code to operate a simple game of tic tac toe can only go so far before I succumb to the [pit of despair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_of_despair). I need a purpose greater than simply finishing this course and then throwing fate up to the gods. What is this long highway and where is it taking me?

To help guide my process, I’ve decided to regularly research and report on opportunities to help keep me on track. So, first on the inspiration list is the startup Re:Coded, which was founded to teach code to conflict affected youth in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.

Objectively, it’s a brilliant cause, providing relevant professional training to people stripped of countless resources both tangible and intangible. However, I must admit I also have personal reasons for being interested. The seed was planted when I met a man in New Zealand 11 years ago, who ran a convenience store. We had a friendly chat and I asked him where he was from. 

“I come from Iraq,” he said. The simple declaration stung. The US was still fighting its war in this man’s home and I felt guilty as I stood before this refugee. I’d never met an Iraqi. All I could do was apologize. I expected a certain reaction, but the man didn’t possess an ounce of bitterness or blame. His graciousness and kindness left a permanent impression. 

Nevertheless, I spent the next decade mostly avoiding the barrage of bad news coming out of the Middle East. One horrific story after another, every day, and what was I equipped to do about it? Then, a moment of boredom one evening last summer led me to another Iraqi, this time through Tinder. Getting to know this incredibly resilient young man, who was so passionate about the land his family had fled, ultimately set in motion my own obsession for the region’s culture, language, and history.  

Back to Re:Coded. I believe everyone needs two keys to maintain hope amidst the hard knocks of life: first, of course, is love. Second, is education. As three students in Qaraqosh [report in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p27EbmshLjY), the local youth have hopes and dreams, but instability and lack of resources hinder achievements.  

The only reason I know of Qaraqosh is because Re:Coded recently posted a job listing for a web development facilitator based in this town. Google the name and the first article that comes up reads, “Iraq’s largest Christian town taken over by ISIS.” Oh, lovely. YEAH, I want to work there. Further down the first page of search results, a *Guardian* article from last December reports, “For Iraq’s Christians, a bittersweet first Christmas home after Isis takeover.” Woof. Technically this is progress, but it still doesn’t breed much confidence. Serious kudos to Re:Coded taking the lead. It's exactly where it needs to be.

But even the aid needs aid, beyond safety and security. Considering these students are being sponsored, where is all the money coming from? 

“[The organization] faces spiraling costs,” a [*Reuters* article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-displaced-coding/having-fled-fighting-iraqis-and-syrians-learn-to-code-idUSKBN15O25U) reported, “and is struggling to retain students who must also dedicate time to more short-term needs such as feeding their families.”

If Re:Coded needs a volunteer to help raise money, SIGN ME UP. We can't allow this courageous endeavor to fail, for so many reasons. One topic I feel particularly alarmed by is the [destruction of the region's art and artifacts](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/07/31/iraq.babylon.damage/). Perhaps the emerging science of computational archaeology could employ local coders and help salvage damages. This is the heart of Mesopotamia, after all - Earth's cradle of civilization and mankind's collective history. But that is another post for another day.
